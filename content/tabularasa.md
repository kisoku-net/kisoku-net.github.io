# A slate, emblankened.

Welcome back...

The urge to start over increases with each perceived failure. Perhaps it will be different this time. My writing skills atrophy over time, and as I become increasingly dependent on mental models, my frustration with my work exponentiates.

Perhaps by continuing to exercise, entropy will be reduced.

I have bigger plans for this site, best left unspoken for now. I will also dedicate some effort to restoring the historical content of this site in due time.

Until then, I shall ponder the void a little longer.
